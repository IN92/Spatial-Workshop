# Spatial Data Science Workshop
## Cristina Kadar & Benjamin Ryder (PhD students @ ETHZ)
## January 28th 2018 (Applied Machine Learning Days @ EPFL)

**Goal:** Familiarize participants with the challenges of working with geo-referenced multi-modal data (governmental data, open data, social media, etc.). Build first visualizations and prediction models.

**Theory:** First, we will talk about the definition of spatial data science, the specifics of map data, and some methods for spatial models. You can find the up-to-date slides on that here:

**Application:** Then, we will go through a hands-on session to answer a real-world problem, for which we have prepared data and code for you. All materials are available in this git repository. 

*Problem:* How are Airnbnb prices influenced by the listing properties and the attributes of the neighborhood?
 
*Data:* We have already pre-processed the data from various sources: insideairbnb, census, NYC open data platform, Foursquare, Streetscore and made it available for you on point level and census tract level.
 
*Code:* To run the the IPython notebooks you need to install some specific libraries: pysal, geopandas, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, etc.
