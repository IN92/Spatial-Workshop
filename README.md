# Spatial Data Science Workshop
## Cristina Kadar & Benjamin Ryder

**Goal:** Familiarize participants with the challenges of working with geo-referenced multi-modal data (governmental data, open data, online digital traces, etc.).
**Problem:** How are Airnbnb prices influenced by the listing properties and the attributes of the neighborhood?
 
**Data:** We will make the data available for download on the tutorialâ€™s website.
 
**Software:**
--code: python (pysal, stats, maybe scikit-learn) and Jupiter Notebook.
--visualization: QGIS or cartoDB.
Participants will be required to have the packages/tools pre-installed. We will send the final requirements as soon as we know them.
